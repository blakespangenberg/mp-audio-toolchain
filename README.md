# Metroid Prime Audio Toolchain
This repository is a streamlined toolchain for modifying music and sound effects in Metroid Prime, and packaging them for distribution.

Note that it is illegal to share the source game data directly, so only custom sounds can be distributed when sharing custom audio mods. If any of the links are dead, please let me know.

# Setup
TBD
