# Metroid Prime Audio Toolchain
This repository is a streamlined toolchain for modifying music and sound effects in Metroid Prime, and packaging them for distribution. This is for Windows only (tested on Windows 10). 

Note that it is illegal to share the source game data directly, so only custom sounds can be distributed when sharing custom audio mods. If any of the links are dead, please let me know.

Also note that I am only the author of the batch scripts, please see each included tool's license and/or homepage for more information.

# Usage
*Note: These tools can sometimes be falsely flagged as viruses by aftermarket antivirus programs. Disable your antivirus before using this toolchain.*

YouTube Guide: TBD

There are 5 `.bat` files which streamline the modding process. To use them, simply double click and wait for them to complete. They are numbered roughly in the order they are needed.
