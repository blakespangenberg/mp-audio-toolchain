# Metroid Prime Audio Toolchain
This repository is a streamlined toolchain for modifying music and sound effects in Metroid Prime, and packaging them for distribution. This is for Windows only (tested on Windows 10). 

Note that it is illegal to share the source game data directly, so only custom sounds can be distributed when sharing custom audio mods. If any of the links are dead, please let me know.

# Usage
*Note: These tools can sometimes be falsely flagged as viruses by aftermarked antivirus programs. Disable your antivirus before using this toolchain.*

## Extract Files
Copy your legally obtained copy of Metroid Prime to the root directory and name it `prime.iso`. Double click `extract.bat` and wait for the audio files to be extracted from your game.

## Edit Audio
Double click `edit.bat` to launch audacity. Then TBD.
