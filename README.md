# Metroid Prime Audio Toolchain
This repository is a streamlined toolchain for modifying music and sound effects in Metroid Prime, and packaging them for distribution. This is for Windows only (tested on Windows 10). 

It is illegal to share the any of the original game's data, so *only* custom audio can be distributed when sharing custom audio mods. This used to be tricky because sound effects in this game are packaged tightly around similar audio files. This tools helps by providing a way to isolate just the custom audio files from the rest of the game and a means of packaging them so that a user has everything they need to apply it stored in a single .zip file.

Please note that I am only the author of the batch scripts. Please see each included tool's license and/or homepage for more information.
